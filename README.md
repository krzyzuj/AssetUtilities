# Unreal Asset Utilities

[![ArtStation - krzyzuj](https://img.shields.io/badge/ArtStation-krzyzuj-blue?logo=artstation)](https://artstation.com/krzyzuj)

A collection of Python tools for Unreal Engine that automate the asset pipeline.
Each module registers its scripts under the appropriate menu category, as specified in each moduleâ€™s README section.

## Requirements
Requires [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) 11.3 installed in Unreal Engine's Python environment to run.

## Installation
Install Pillow via pip for Unreal Engine's Python Environment.
Unreal Engine > Project Settings > Plugins - Python > Additional Paths > path to AssetUtilities folder > Restart Editor
Configure your settings in config_TextureUtilities.json.
Launch the scripts from their registered menus in the editor.

# Channel Packer

Gathers the required maps, validates them, and packs channels according to your presets, significantly speeding up the workflow.
Registers under the Texture2D and folder context menus.

Config sections: Global, Generators, Channel Packer

> Note: Originally a single module with a shared backend for both the standalone version and Unreal Engine.
It was later split for ease of use, but the core structure remains the same, so changes are drop-in across versions.

## Features
- Multiple packing modes defined in the config let you generate various texture combinations in a single pass.
- Automatic organization: moves created and/or source maps into subdirectories to keep things tidy.
- Flexible inputs: supports packing grayscale textures as well as extracting specific channels from RGB sources.
- Validation & logging: checks for resolution mismatches, incorrect filenames, and missing maps, and logs any issues it finds.
- Texture settings: applies the specified compression settings and sRGB flag to newly created textures.
- Auto-repair options: can fill missing channels with default values and rescale mismatched textures when needed.
